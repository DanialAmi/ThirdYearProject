      "     b The holding in this case does not render the advisory Guidelines immune from constitutional scrutiny see eg Peugh v United States 569 U S ___ or render sentencing procedures entirely immune from scrutiny under the due process clause Williams v New York 337 U S 241 252 n 18 This Court holds only that the Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a challenge under the voidforvagueness doctrine Pp 1011\n",

      "     For the former the Court has explained that the voidforvagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement Id at 357 For the latter the Court has explained that statutes fixing sentences Johnson supra at ___ slip op at 4 citing United States v Batchelder 442 U S 114 123 1979 must specify the range of available sentences with sufficient clarity id at 123 see also United States v Evans 333 U S 483 1948 cf Giaccio v Pennsylvania 382 U S 399 1966\n",
      "     In Johnson we applied the vagueness rule to a statute fixing permissible sentences The ACCA's residual clause where applicable required sentencing courts to increase a defendant's prison term from a statutory maximum of 10 years to a minimum of 15 years That requirement thus fixedin an impermissibly vague waya higher range of sentences for certain defendants See Alleyne v United States 570 U S ___ ___ 2013 describing the legally prescribed range of available sentences as the penalty fixed to a crime\n",
      "     Unlike the ACCA however the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible range of sentences To the contrary they merely guide the exercise of a court's discretion in choosing an appropriate sentence within the statutory range Accordingly the Guidelines are not subject to a vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause The residual clause in 4B12a2 therefore is not void for vagueness\n",
      "A\n",
      "     The limited scope of the voidforvagueness doctrine in this context is rooted in the history of federal sentencing Instead of enacting specific sentences for particular federal crimes Congress historically permitted district courts wide discretion to decide whether the offender should be incarcerated and for how long Mistretta v United States 488 U S 361 363 1989 For most crimes Congress set forth a range of sentences and sentencing courts had almost unfettered discretion to select the actual length of a defendant's sentence within the customarily wide range Congress had enacted Id at 364 see also eg Apprendi v New Jersey 530 U S 466 481482 2000 Williams v New York 337 U S 241 247248 1949 That discretion allowed district courts to craft individualized sentences taking into account the facts of the crime and the history of the defendant As a result serious disparities in sentences    were common Mistretta supra at 365\n",
      "     Yet in the long history of discretionary sentencing this Court has never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range United States v Booker 543 U S 220 233 2005 see also eg Apprendi supra at 481 Nothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion    in imposing a judgment within the range prescribed by statute Giaccio supra at 405 n 8 We intend to cast no doubt whatever on the constitutionality of the settled practice of many States to leave to juries finding defendants guilty of a crime the power to fix punishment within legally prescribed limits\n",
      "     More specifically our cases have never suggested that a defendant can successfully challenge as vague a sentencing statute conferring discretion to select an appropriate sentence from within a statutory range even when that discretion is unfettered In fact our reasoning in Batchelder suggests the opposite This Court considered in that case the constitutionality of two overlapping criminal provisions that authorized different maximum penalties for the same conduct 442 U S at 115116 The Court held that the sentencing provisions were not void for vagueness because they specified the penalties available and defined the punishment authorized upon conviction for each crime Id at 123 Although the statutes created uncertainty as to which crime may be charged and therefore what penalties may be imposed they did so to no greater extent than would a single statute authorizing various alternative punishments Ibid emphasis added By specifying the range of penalties that prosecutors and judges may seek and impose Congress had fulfilled its duty Id at 126 citing Evans supra at 483 emphasis added Indeed no party to this case suggests that a system of purely discretionary sentencing could be subject to a vagueness challenge\n",
      "B\n",
      "     The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 departed from this regime by establishing several factors to guide district courts in exercising their traditional sentencing discretion 18 U S C 3553 Congress in the same Act created the United States Sentencing Commission and charged it with establishing guidelines to be used for sentencing Mis tretta supra at 367 The result of the Commission's work is the Federal Sentencing Guidelines which are one of the sentencing factors that the Act requires courts to consider 3553a4\n",
      "     The Guidelines were initially binding on district courts Booker 543 U S at 233 but this Court in Booker rendered them effectively advisory id at 245 Although the Guidelines remain the starting point and the initial benchmark for sentencing a sentencing court may no longer rely exclusively on the Guidelines range rather the court must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented and the other statutory factors Gall v United States 552 U S 38 49 50 2007 The Guidelines thus continue to guide district courts in exercising their discretion by serving as the framework for sentencing Peugh v United States 569 U S ___ ___ 2013 slip op at 11 but they do not constrain that discretion id at ___ Thomas J dissenting slip op at 2\n",
      "     Because they merely guide the district courts' discretion the Guidelines are not amenable to a vagueness challenge As discussed above the system of purely discretionary sentencing that predated the Guidelines was constitutionally permissible If a system of unfettered discretion is not unconstitutionally vague then it is difficult to see how the present system of guided discretion could be\n",
      "     The advisory Guidelines also do not implicate the twin concerns underlying vagueness doctrineproviding notice and preventing arbitrary enforcement As to notice even perfectly clear Guidelines could not provide notice to a person who seeks to regulate his conduct so as to avoid particular penalties within the statutory range See eg Grayned v City of Rockford 408 U S 104 108 1972 That is because even if a person behaves so as to avoid an enhanced sentence under the careeroffender guideline the sentencing court retains discretion to impose the enhanced sentence See eg Pepper v United States 562 U S 476 501 2011 Our postBooker decisions make clear that a district court may in appropriate cases impose a nonGuidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the Commission's views As we held in Irizarry v United States 555 U S 708 2008 the due process concerns that    require notice in a world of mandatory Guidelines no longer apply Id at 714 see id at 713 Any expectation subject to due process protection    that a criminal defendant would receive a sentence within the presumptively applicable Guidelines range did not survive our decision in Booker which invalidated the mandatory features of the Guidelines All of the notice required is provided by the applicable statutory range which establishes the permissible bounds of the court's sentencing discretion\n",

      "     Holding that the Guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause however would cast serious doubt on their validity Many of these other factors appear at least as unclear as 4B12a's residual clause For example courts must assess the need for the sentence imposed to achieve certain goalssuch as to reflect the seriousness of the offense promote respect for the law provide just punishment for the offense afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training    in the most effective manner 3553a2 If petitioner were correct that 4B12a's residual clause were subject to a vagueness challenge we would be hard pressed to find these factors sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement\n",
      "     The Government tries to have it both ways arguing that the individualized sentencing required by the other 3553a factors is different in kind from that required by the Guidelines An inscrutably vague advisory guideline it contends injects arbitrariness into the sentencing process that is not found in the exercise of unguided discretion in a traditional sentencing system Reply Brief for United States 1011 But it is far from obvious that the residual clause implicates the twin concerns of vagueness any more than the statutory command that sentencing courts impose a sentence tailored for example to promote respect for the law 3553a2A And neither the Guidelines nor the other 3553 factors implicate those concerns more than the absence of any guidance at all which the Government concedes is constitutional\n",

      "     The Guidelines today play a central role in federal sentencing Although no longer binding on federal courts see United States v Booker 543 U S 220 245 2005 the Guidelines nonetheless provide the framework for the tens of thousands of federal sentencing proceedings that occur each year MolinaMartinez 578 U S at ___ slip op at 2 A district court must begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range Gall v United States 552 U S 38 4950 2007 The court must entertain the parties' arguments and consider the factors set forth in 18 U S C 3553a as possible grounds for deviation from the Guidelines range 552 U S at 4950 and may not presume the    range is reasonable id at 50 But it must explain any deviation from the range on the record and it must ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance Ibid see Peugh 569 U S at ______ slip op at 1718 A district court that incorrectly calculates the Guidelines range commits reversible procedural error see Gall 552 U S at 51 a district court that imposes a sentence within the correct Guidelines range by contrast may be afforded a presumption that the sentence it has imposed is reasonable see Rita 551 U S at 347\n",

      "     If there were any doubt that advisory sentencing guidelines are subject to constitutional limits we dispelled it in Peugh where we held that the Guidelines are amenable to challenges under the Ex Post Facto Clause See 569 U S at ___ slip op at 1 There the Government argued that the advisory nature of the Guidelines rendered them immune from such claims Id at ___ slip op at 8 But we rejected such an argument The federal system we explained adopts procedural measures intended to make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing and considerable empirical evidence indicates that the    Guidelines have the intended effect Id at ______ slip op at 1213 We declined the Government's invitation to limit our ex post facto jurisprudence to rules that as a formal matter increased the maximum sentence for which a defendant is eligible Id at ___ slip op at 8 And we explained that a rule may exert  'binding legal effect' through    procedural rules and standards for appellate review that in combination encourage district courts to sentence within the guidelines Id at ___ slip op at 16 It was not true we concluded that the Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences ibid instead the Guidelines were just fencelike enoughjust lawlike enoughthat they cannot be shielded from the Constitution's reach\n",
      "     The same principle should dictate the same result in this case How can the Guidelines carry sufficient legal weight to warrant scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment and the Ex Post Facto Clause but not enough to warrant scrutiny under the Due Process Clause Cf United States v Hurlburt 835 F 3d 715 724 CA7 2016 en banc We see no principled way to distinguish Peugh on doctrinal grounds The majority offers no convincing answer It asserts that the Due Process Clause requires a different inquiry than these provisions do Ante at 10 But it does not explain why it views this as relevant to the constitutional status of the Guidelines A court considering a challenge to a criminal statute under the Ex Post Facto Clause will apply a different legal standard than will a court considering a vagueness challenge to the same statute that does not make the statute more or less susceptible to constitutional challenge in one context than the other Our opinion in Peugh is particularly difficult for the majority to escape given that the Ex Post Facto Clause like the Due Process Clause's prohibition against vagueness is rooted in concerns about fair warning and  'fundamental fairness'  569 U S at ___ plurality opinion slip op at 13 The majority musters no persuasive explanation for why those concerns would have less force in this context than in that one That is because none exists4\n",

      "     Johnson confronted and rejected a version of this argument There the Government contended that dozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms like 'substantial risk' 'grave risk' and 'unreasonable risk'  terms thatin its viewwere indistinguishable from the residual clause at issue in that case 576 U S at ___ slip op at 12 We rejected the argument explaining that such rules called for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to realworld conduct 'the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly    some matter of degree'  Ibid quoting Nash v United States 229 U S 373 377 1913 What rendered the ACCA's residual clause unconstitutionally vague we explained was not that it required gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages on a particular occasion but that it required the application of an ambiguous standard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime 576 U S at ___ slip op at 12 Holding the residual clause unconstitutionally vague in other words cast no doubt on the dozens of laws elsewhere in the U S Code requiring the application of general standards to particular conduct\n",
