On the evening of July 21, 2007, Moise William's car was halted at a sobriety checkpoint on New Hampshire Route 28 manned by Auburn, New Hampshire, police officers. The checkpoint had been authorized by a state judge on petition of the town's police department. All vehicles (except tractor trailers due to parking-space problems) were stopped briefly. When William rolled down the driver's side window, the officer who had approached smelled marijuana and noticed that William's eyes were glassy and bloodshot. The officer asked William to step out of the car.
In the ensuing search of the car, marijuana was found. During the search, a fireman standing nearby saw William throw a package on the ground; later testing revealed it to contain crack cocaine. A further search with a drug-sniffing dog revealed more marijuana in the car. William was arrested and indicted on two counts of possessing a controlled substance, one for marijuana and the other for “cocaine base (‘crack’).” 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) (2006). The government also alleged that the crack cocaine weighed three or more grams and filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851 alleging that William had a prior conviction for possession of crack cocaine.
William moved to suppress all of the drug evidence on the ground that the drugs were the fruits of an illegal stop. The district court held a hearing, heard testimony, and concluded that the stop of William's car was lawful. In response to a second motion to suppress, the court also held that the car search was lawful, but that issue is not before us on this appeal. Thereafter William was tried on both counts.
Among the items seized when William was stopped was a wrapper containing eleven small bags. At trial a government expert testified that these contained crack cocaine weighing approximately 3.6 grams; but pursuant to laboratory policy, the expert had weighed only five of the eleven bags, determined the average weight per bag, and multiplied by eleven to estimate the total weight of all of the bags. The five bags tested weighed 1.64 grams, making the expert's estimate 3.6 grams for all eleven.1
Although the weight went only to penalty, the issue was submitted to the jury-as required by Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)-because a weight exceeding three grams would raise the maximum possible penalty. 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). The trial judge expressed unease about the chemist's method, given that the margin was small (3 grams versus 3.6) and the standard of proof was “beyond a reasonable doubt.” However, the trial court denied William's motion seeking a judgment of acquittal based on the weight issue, Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, and the jury convicted William on both counts and found by special verdict that the total amount of crack cocaine exceeded three grams.
In sentencing William on the crack cocaine conviction, the trial court applied a statutory provision, 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), setting a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for possession of more than three grams of cocaine base when the defendant has a “prior conviction ․ under this subsection.” The court sentenced William to the five-year prison term, to run concurrently with a one-year sentence for possession of marijuana. William now appeals to challenge both his conviction and sentence on the crack cocaine charge.
The challenge to the conviction rests solely on the lawfulness of the stop. Although individualized suspicion is normally required for a car stop and “probable cause” is required for an arrest, the Fourth Amendment rubric is “reasonableness.” City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000); United States v. Almeida, 434 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.2006). Under this rubric, the Supreme Court has permitted vehicle checkpoints and very brief inquiries of all drivers for certain purposes and with certain safeguards: one of the allowed uses is for sobriety checkpoints, the principal authority being Michigan Department of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 110 S.Ct. 2481, 110 L.Ed.2d 412 (1990).2
The threshold requirement under Sitz and Edmond-that sobriety concerns be the primary purpose of the checkpoint-is met in this case. See Edmond, 531 U.S. at 47-48; Sitz, 496 U.S. at 451. New Hampshire has a general procedure for authorizing sobriety checkpoints; and in this case a plan was submitted and approved by a state judge, and the directions to the officers were consistent with operating a sobriety checkpoint. The police were aware that other crimes might come to light; thus, a drug-sniffing dog was kept in reserve but brought forward to William's car only after drugs had been initially found due to William's appearance and the odor of marijuana.
William's argument that the checkpoint's primary purpose was something other than detecting impaired driving consists mostly of objections to the quality of the statistical data cited in the petition seeking approval for the checkpoint. But such weaknesses give no reason in this case to think that the district court clearly erred in concluding that the government was in fact conducting a sobriety checkpoint. United States v. Green, 293 F.3d 855, 859 (5th Cir.2002) (reviewing district court findings on primary purpose for clear error); United States v. Davis, 270 F.3d 977, 980 (D.C.Cir.2001) (same).
William cites two decisions from the District of Columbia Circuit that have found traffic checkpoints doubtful in particular cases, but in both cases, the evidence suggested that the stops were not primarily vehicle registration checks, as the officers claimed, but rather general anti-crime stops implemented as part of broader crime-control task forces. See United States v. Bowman, 496 F.3d 685, 693-94 (D.C.Cir.2007) (remanding for further fact-finding on primary purpose); United States v. Davis, 270 F.3d 977, 981-82 (D.C.Cir.2001) (same). The reasons for allowing one kind of use and barring another can be debated; but the short answer is that the Supreme Court has thus distinguished and that is the end of the matter. Edmond, 531 U.S. at 47-48.
Other cases William cites likewise involved affirmative evidence that the checkpoint's stated purpose was pretextual. United States v. Huguenin, 154 F.3d 547, 555-56 (6th Cir.1998) (checkpoint funded by drug interdiction sources was supervised by narcotics officer); United States v. Ramirez-Gonzalez, 87 F.3d 712, 715-16 (5th Cir.1996) (remanding for an evidentiary hearing based on similar evidence). Unlike those cases, William does not show that the Auburn checkpoint was part of some task force or program aimed at some purpose other than sobriety.
Beyond assessing the legitimacy of the purpose, Sitz and other checkpoint cases have used Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 50-51, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979), as the source of a further balancing test for determining the reasonableness of the checkpoint. Several formulations have been used but a helpful summary is provided by a Fourth Circuit decision, United States v. Henson, No. 08-4221, 2009 WL 3792435, at *2 (4th Cir. Nov.13, 2009) (citations omitted):
If the primary purpose was valid, the court must then judge the checkpoint's reasonableness on the basis of individual circumstances․ This requires balancing “ ‘the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty.’ ” ․ Factors to weigh intrusiveness include whether the checkpoint: (1) is clearly visible; (2) is part of some systematic procedure that strictly limits the discretionary authority of police officers; and (3) detains drivers no longer than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of checking a license and registration, unless other facts come to light creating a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
In the present case, Sitz establishes the “gravity of the public concerns” with the death and injury toll taken by drunken drivers and the fact that sobriety checkpoints can “advance the public interest” sufficiently to make such a checkpoint rea
